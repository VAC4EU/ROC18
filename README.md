This script was developed for the [Objective 1 of the SAFETY-VAC project](https://catalogues.ema.europa.eu/node/4094/administrative-details) and was used to produce the data included in the corresponding report.

When cloning the repository you download also a set of synthetic data, stored [here](https://github.com/VAC4EU/ROC18/tree/main/i_input_subpop), that can be used to test the script. Some selected steps can also be tested on dummy data: the tests are stored [in this folder](https://github.com/VAC4EU/ROC18/tree/main/i_input_synthetic_cohort).

A graphical representation of the steps of the script is available here: [https://vac4eu.github.io/ROC18/diagram.html](https://vac4eu.github.io/ROC18/diagram.html)
