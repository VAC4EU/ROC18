      <description>D3_PERSONScontains the cleaned version of PERSONS, where birth date and death date are reconstituted as dates
D3_events_DEATHcontains the deaths observed in the study population
D3_output_spells_categorycontains the spells exited from CreateSpells, i.e., all the continuous spells of observation period of each person, stratified per op_meaning. op_meaning is by default the same for all observation periods, and is set in 05_subpopulations_restricting_meanings for those data sources where the analysis is conducted on subpopulations having different sets of data banks</description>

      <description>D3_events_OUTCOMESIM_simplecontains the outcomes observed in the study population, including negative outcomes but excluding covid and complex algorithms
D3_events_OUTCOMECOMPL_complexcontains the outcomes observed in the study population, including only complex algorithms
D3_events_ALL_OUTCOMEScontains the outcomes observed in the study population, including negative outcomes but excluding covid
QC_all_components_OUTCOMEOccurrence of components of the outcome OUTCOME during 2019 (and to be dropped, during one year of lookback), per meaning, to all persons in the study population at 1/1/2019 or entering during 2019</description>

      <description>D3_Total_study_populationstudy population with entry and exit dates, date of birth, gender, dates and type of vaccinations
D3_study_population_cohortcontains the baseline characteristics of the study population, for the cohort study
D3_TD_variable_conditioncontains the time-dependent evolution of the binary variable condition. Only changes of status are recorded, with date when the condition changes; the components of the condition last 365 days if they are diagnosis, and 90 days if they are drug proxies; unique spells are created when the algorithm is 1 (if either a dianosis or a drug proxy is active), and the algorithm is reverted to values 0 whenever no component is active</description>

      <description>D5_IR_backgroundbackground rates of AESIs, per presence or absence of history of COVID, age and sex, month and year
D5_IR_background_stdage-standardised background rates of AESIs, in 2019 and 2020, per presence or absence of history of COVID; method: R-package dsr; standard: European population
D5_Pre_backgroundPoint prevalence estimates will be calculated at the start of each year: the numerator is the persons with the disease in the year prior, denominator is all persons present at the start of each calendar year.</description>
