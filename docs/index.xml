      <description>D3_PERSONScontains the cleaned version of PERSONS, where birth date and death date are reconstituted as dates
D3_events_DEATHcontains the deaths observed in the study population
D3_output_spells_categorycontains the spells exited from CreateSpells, i.e., all the continuous spells of observation period of each person, stratified per op_meaning. op_meaning is by default the same for all observation periods, and is set in 05_subpopulations_restricting_meanings for those data sources where the analysis is conducted on subpopulations having different sets of data banks</description>

D3_events_ALL_OUTCOMEScontains the outcomes observed in the study population, including negative outcomes but excluding covid
QC_all_components_OUTCOMEOccurrence of components of the outcome OUTCOME during 2019 (and to be dropped, during one year of lookback), per meaning, to all persons in the study population at 1/1/2019 or entering during 2019</description>

      <description>D3_Total_study_populationstudy population with entry and exit dates, date of birth, gender, dates and type of vaccinations
D3_TD_allcontains the time-dependent evolution of the binary variable condition. Only changes of status are recorded, with date when the condition changes; the components of the condition last 365 days if they are diagnosis, and 90 days if they are drug proxies; unique spells are created when the algorithm is 1 (if either a dianosis or a drug proxy is active), and the algorithm is reverted to values 0 whenever no component is active</description>
